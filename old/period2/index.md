### Node.js+Express, Testing with JavaScript, NoSQL with MongoDB and Mongoose

*In this period we will introduce Express, a minimal and flexible node.js package, that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications. We will also introduce the Mocha test framework, together with a number of supplementing packages for assertions, mocking etc. Finally you will be introduced to a new kind of database - NoSQL Databases, with mongoDB as the document database we are going to use.*
