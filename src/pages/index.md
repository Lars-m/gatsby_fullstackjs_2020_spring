title: "Full Stack JavaScript - Spring 2020 - General Information"
headertext: |
  JavaScript is everywhere. Once a simple misunderstood language, used only for simple browser manipulations, it has now 
  evolved along with the Web and finds itself entrenched in all modern browsers, complex Web applications, mobile apps, server-side applications, desktop applications and in emerging platforms like the Internet of Things

  This is the language we are going to "have a lot of fun with" in the coming months :-)
