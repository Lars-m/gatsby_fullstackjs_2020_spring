  Progressive Web Apps (PWA)

  What is a PWA, Introduction to Service Workers and Caching

 ####****#####
---

#### Before this lesson you should decide for PWA or GrahpQL:
_The videos given below are mostly informative and are meant to give you the enough information to pick one of the two topics. The lessons planned for the topic you DO NOT select are **your time** to spend as you like ;-)_
<!--readings_begin-->
- [Progressive Web Apps: What, Why, and How? (33 min.)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eodArdGRIVQ)
- [What is GraphQL? (14 min.)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjXb3PRL9WI)
<!--readings_end-->
 Watch the video's above, and pick a topic

## Do this if you have decided for PWA’s

Everything (including lectures) related to Progressive Web App’s will be taken from this [Google-tutorial](https://developers.google.com/web/ilt/pwa/), which includes videos, slides, Concepts and Lab’s (exercises).

What I will do (no later than Friday) is to come up with the learning goals for this topic in the usual way, and come up with a plan for how you should move forward, and what you as a minimum should do during this period.

If you need more info about this strategy, it will be given tomorrow. If not, just go ahead. You can do it all from back home since it all is in this tutorial.
